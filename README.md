# easydrop

Easily share files through AirDrop *without a Mac*


`easydrop` is a simple cli utility that's ment for quick and easy ~~send~~/receive files with AirDrop on ~~Windoza~~/Linux

// Strikethough words are stuff that doesn't work yet tho I would really want it to

This is a very simple wrapper around much much bigger work of guys @seemoo-lab - it uses [owl](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl) for low-level AirDrop network layer as well as [opendrop](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop) for some app level - HUGE shout-out for them for reverse enineering all of this!!!

// Note: tho I'm thinking of also forking `opendrop` in future for better control over the flow
